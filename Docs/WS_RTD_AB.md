# JSON FORMATS
There are 4 types: Json-RTD, Json-HIST, Json-CMD, Json-ACK

### 1) RTD format in json message
Currently, minimum periodicty/timeframe/interval of bars is 1 minute.
Valid fields in the json object
**ORDER** See the Json recommended section, rtd message has to start with "n" field. Subsequent order does not matter.
**STRUCTURE** This is Array of JSON strings

>'n', 'd', 't', 'o', 'h', 'l', 'c', 'v', 'oi', 'x1', 'x2', ( for Quotations )
's','pc','bs','bp','as','ap', 'do', 'dh', 'dl' ( for Realtime Quote window)

> 'n'=symbol name, date, time, open, high, low, close, volume, open interest,
>'x1'=Aux1, 'x2'=Aux2
's'=total daily vol, 'pc'=prev day close, 
'do', 'dh', 'dl', are Day Open, High, Low
'bs', 'bp', 'as', 'ap', are bid size/ bid price /ask size / ask price 

>Sample rtd json
```sh
[{"n":"SYM1","t":101500,"d":20241130,"c":3,"o":6,"h":9,"l":1,"v":256,"oi":0,"bp":4,"ap":5,"s":12045,"bs":1,"as":1,"pc":3,"do":3,"dh":9,"dl":1},{"n":"SYM2","t":101500,"d":20241130,"c":3,"o":6,"h":9,"l":1,"v":256,"oi":0,"bp":4,"ap":5,"s":12045,"bs":1,"as":1,"pc":3,"do":3,"dh":9,"dl":1},{"n":"SYM3","t":101500,"d":20241130,"c":3,"o":6,"h":9,"l":1,"v":256,"oi":0,"bp":4,"ap":5,"s":12045,"bs":1,"as":1,"pc":3,"do":3,"dh":9,"dl":1}]
```
Supported Date/Time formats:
```sh
milliseconds not yet supprted
u = unix timestamp localtime()   ( type: integer64 )
g = unix timestamp gmtime()      ( type: integer64 )
d = date                         ( type: integer )
t = time                         ( type: integer )
u, g and d are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, but any one is mandatory.
"t" is mandatory for RTD along with "d"
/U=unix_local_ms /G=unix_utc_ms (To-Do:)
```

Refer to Amibroker ADK link above for data types.
'd'.'t','as','bs' as integer,
float is safe for the rest.
To-do: unix timestamp(u/g), seconds interval

if required fields are not found, they are set to ZERO & that will distort candles.
```sh
o, h, l, c = open,high,low,last_traded_price = mandatory for new Quote
v, oi, x1, x2 = optional and set to 0 if absent

Realtime Quote window variables are optional, but they
are required for this feature to work properly.
```

### 2) History format in json message
Parse a history data JSON string that is used to backfill a Ticker

>This is all the backfill records in Array format for a single ticker
format specifier is fieldsStr = "dtohlcvixy"
only valid fields should be set and in that particular order.

 **ORDER** The sequence of columns in hostorical data can be anything set by the user, but it has to match its character in the Format specifier string. The beginning of the json message will start with "hist" containing Symbol name followed by "format" field containing the Format specifier string.
 
 **Important: History Array records must be in ascending order**, ie. Least DateTime first.
```sh
(ugdt)ohlcvixy
milliseconds not yet supprted
u = unix timestamp localtime()   ( type: integer64 )
g = unix timestamp gmtime()      ( type: integer64 )
d = date                         ( type: integer )
t = time                         ( type: integer )
u, g and d are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, but any one is mandatory.
"t" is mandatory for intraday bars with "d"

o = open price        ( type: float ), required
h = high price        ( type: float ), required
l = low price         ( type: float ), required
c = close price       ( type: float ), required
v = volume            ( type: float ), optional
i = open interest     ( type: float ), optional
x = aux1              ( type: float ), optional
y = aux2              ( type: float ), optional
/U=unix_local_ms /G=unix_utc_ms (To-Do:) 
```
if required fields are not found, they are set to ZERO & that will distort candles.

##### bars field is JSON Value Array
>Sample Date-Time
>DATE (optional TIME) d,t is supplied as INT,
```sh
{"hist":"SYM1","format":"dtohlcvi","bars":[[20240601,100000,22.1,22.5,22.1,22.8,120,0],
[20240602,110000,22.8,22.7,22.3,22.4,180,0],[20240603,120000,22.8,22.7,22.3,22.4,180,0]]}
```

>Sample unix timestamp
```sh
({"hist":"SYM1","format":"uohlcv","bars":[[1731670819,22.1,22.5,22.1,22.8,120],
[1731761419,22.8,22.7,22.3,22.4,180]]}
```
>u=Unix Local timestamp	OR g=Unix GMT/UTC timestamp
that is use ( windows struct tm = localtime() or tm = gmtime()

 
##### Backfill style-01
>Currently, Vendor backfill means N most recent days data
so plugin also sets Bars from the first of this Array to the last bar
the existing bars are overwritten, from first bar of hist.
old_data + WS_data
Now, backfill means old_data + backfill (upto last backfill)
then, old_data + backfill_data + Rt_data ( from bars after last backfill bar, if any )
[![img sample_server1](https://github.com/ideepcoder/Rtd_Ws_AB_plugin/blob/main/images/help/Plugin_menu.png?raw=true)

##### Backfill style-02 *To-do:*
Inserting historical data into AmiBroker Database 

### 3) CMD format in json message
Work in progress, subject to change.
> ALL REQUESTS made by **plug-in TO** Server have only "cmd" and "arg fields"
> Server should REPLY to all above REQUESTS with same "cmd" and "arg" fields. Additionally inserting the "code" which is integer.
> Code values for OK=200, and OTHER/BAD=400

> ALL REQUESTS made by **Server To** Plug-in will have valid "cmd" and "arg" fields. Additionally, all SERVER-side requests will have code=300 which is integer.
>( The only exceptions is json-RTD and json-HIST formats.)

> Plug-in will respond with **Acknowledgement TO Server** for all code=300 Server-side REQUESTS with json-ACK "ack" with server-request, "arg" with description and "code" which is integer
> Code values for OK=200, and OTHER/BAD=400


#### 3.1) Request CMD from plugin to "Server"

##### a) First Access automatic symbol backfill request
This is a special automatic backfill request command that is sent to the server when a symbol is accessed in Amibroker for the first time. Server can choose to ignore this request or respond with a json-History backfill data of a desired period.
{"cmd":"bfauto","arg":"SYMBOL_NAME DateNum TimeNum"}  last Quote timestamp sent when symbol has some data
{"cmd":"bffull","arg":"SYMBOL_NAME"}  sent when symbol has NO data
```sh
{"cmd":"bfauto","arg":"SYM3 20241125 134500"}
{"cmd":"bffull","arg":"SYM9"}
```

##### b) single symbol backfill
{"cmd":"bfsym","arg":"reserved SYMBOL_NAME int_preset"}
```sh
{"cmd":"bfsym","arg":"y SYM1 3"}
```
##### c) ALL symbol backfill
{"cmd":"bfall","arg":"x"}
```sh
{"cmd":"bfall","arg":"x"}
```
For ALL Symbol backfill, client application should still send individual Json-hist messages for each symbol.
##### d) ADD symbol to SUBSCRIBE rtd
{"cmd":"addsym","arg":"SYMBOL_NAME"}
```sh
{"cmd":"addsym","arg":"SYM10"}
```
##### e) REMOVE symbol OR UNSUBSCRIBE rtd
{"cmd":"remsym","arg":"SYMBOL_NAME"}
```sh
{"cmd":"remsym","arg":"SYM6"}
```


#### 3.2) Response CMD "to WS_RTD" Plug-in from Server

##### a) General acknowledgement reponse
{"cmd":"CMD_SENT","code":int_code,"arg":"response string"}
Mandatory code field
```sh
{"cmd":"remsym","code":200,"arg":"SYM6 unsubscribed ok"}    /* sucess example*/
{"cmd":"addsym","code":400,"arg":"XYZ9 subscribe error, invalid"} /* failure example*/
```


#### 3.3) Request CMD "to WS_RTD" Plug-in "from" Server
Mandatory code=300
{"cmd":"request_cmd","code":300,"arg":"request_arg"}
##### a) REMOVE or DELETE a Symbol "IN" plug-in Database
{"cmd":"dbremsym","code":300,"arg":"SYMBOL_NAME"}
Case-sensitive match
This is useful to FREE memory in the plug-in DB
```sh
{"cmd":"dbremsym","code":300,"arg":"SYM9"}
returns {"ack","code":200."arg":"SYM9 removed from DB"}     /* success */
returns {"ack","code":400,"arg":"SYM9 NOT found in DB")     /* failure */
```
##### b) Get the List of Symbols in Plug-in Database
{"cmd":"dbgetlist","code":300,"arg":""}
"arg" field required, can set empty or some string description
returns a comma-string of symbols
```sh
{"cmd":"dbgetlist","code":300,"arg":"DB Symbol list requested at 14:56:00"}
returns {"ack":"dbgetlist","code":200,"arg"="AA,AAPL,AXP,BA,C,CAT,IBM,INTC,"}
```
##### c) Get the Base Time Interval of Plug-in Database
{"cmd":"dbgetbase","code":300,"arg":""}
"arg" field required, can set empty
returns a STRING with base time interval in seconds(convert to INT)
```sh
{"cmd":"dbgetbase","code":300,"arg":"DB Symbol list requested at 14:56:00"}
returns {"ack":"dbgetbase","code":200,"arg"="60"}
```

### 4) ACK format in json message
Plug-in will respond with **Acknowledgement TO Server** for all code=300 Server-side REQUESTS with json-ACK "ack" with server-request, "arg" with description and "code" which is integer
Code values for OK=200, and OTHER/BAD=400
```sh
For samples, check 3.3 Plug-in return messages
```


### Important: Json string compression and format
* Json message should be compressed removing all whitespaces or prettify.
* Use your library Json Encoder to prevent errors.
For example, *The JSON standard requires double quotes and will not accept single quotes*
* The json-type of messages are string matched at the start
* Json CMD, history-format string and RTD fields are all **case-sensitive**
```sh
C++ case-sensitive Raw string match example for performance
R"([{"n")"     // Realtime Data
R"({"cmd")"    // Commands
R"({"hist")"   // Historical Data
```

## Database Plug-in Commands
Explained here [Amibroker Forum](https://forum.amibroker.com/t/documentation-on-batch-data-plugin-command/39269)
Amibroker [Batch window manual](https://www.amibroker.com/guide/h_batch.html)

Every time the Plug-in receives data, it stores is internally in its own temporary storage and notifies Amibroker of new data. Unfortunately, by design, if the Symbol is not being used by the user is anyway, the plug-in may never be able to "push" the data to AB local Database that is persistent.
Therefore, user needs to use a Batch file that consists of an empty Analysis Exploration to force all symbols to fetch data. More on this later.

These are some ways to communicate with the Plug-in from the Amibroker User-Interface OR when the websocket is shutdown and therefore not reachable externally.

##### 1) PushDBtoAB
Batch command to inform plug-in that an all symbol fetch has been performed.

##### 2) ConnectPlugin
Batch command to start the Websocket connection.

##### 3) ShutdownPlugin
Batch command to stop the Websocket connection.

##### 4) DbStatus
Batch command to log some Plug-in statistics.
```sh
[1] DBG: Db() Status Map_size=4, Qt_RingBufr=200, SymList=SYM1,SYM3,SYM4,SYM5,
```
##### 5) Clear First Access/Automatic backfill data
For every first access of a symbol, bfauto or bffull request is sent once only. You can clear the flag with this.

< Add more commands as required>

## Logging and troubleshooting
#### 1) DebugView
WS_RTD uses extensive logging using Windows Debug output.
- Just run [DebugView](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview)
- Set the Filter to "DBG" *(may change this string later)*
- View realtime Plug-in related information here

[![img dbgview11](https://github.com/ideepcoder/Rtd_Ws_AB_plugin/blob/main/images/help/debug1.png?raw=true)]

#### 2) One or some symbols not updating
Check under Symbol > Information window,
```sh
Use only local database = No    (Ensure No, If yes, plug-in-cannot update it)
```

#### 3) View Count of bars that are in Plug-in DB and those that have been updated to Amibroker DB
Whenever new data arrives, whether RTD or Historical, it is immediately stored internally. Amibroker is notified, but AB will choose to to request data only when that symbol is being used.
To visualize that, currently, Two fields in the AB REaltime Quote window are dedicated to that.
```sh
EPS: This column shows the Total count of bars in Plug-in DB
```
```sh
Dividend: This column shows the Total count of bars in updated to AB from the Plug-in DB
```
[![RT window1](https://github.com/ideepcoder/Rtd_Ws_AB_plugin/blob/main/images/help/RT_Data_index.png?raw=true)]

#### 4) AB Plug-in UI Commands: Connect and Shutdown
These commands will only Connect or Disconnect the plug-in (Client Websocket) to the local relay server. Data stored in the Plug-in DB is not affected.
AB Symbols will still get updated if there is fresh data in the plug-in DB while the user has disconnected the plug-in.
The plug-in DB is not persistent, that means, if user Exits Amibroker or Changes the Current DB in Amibroker, only then the plug-in data is cleared.

#### 5) Sample output of Configure settings
```sh
DBG: ConfDlg() RI=300ms, Conn=127.0.0.1:10101, SymLimit=1000, QuoteLimit=250, DbName=Data
```

# WS_RTD Plugin Settings storage
The plugin stores settings in the Windows Registry like Amibroker QT.dll
Amibroker path
```sh
Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\TJP\wsRtD
```
```sh
Nested in TJP\wsRtD\<Database_name>
```
Settings will be UNIQUE to each unique database name created in AB.
ALL Amibroker Databases that share common Database name but are different filesystem path will "still" share the same settings.
This is the best of both, allows the user to separate or share settings as required.
```sh
Example 1:
Amibroker DB name: Data with their respective paths
C:\sample1\Data
D:\archive\old_sample\Data
```
*Both AB DBs above will share the same settings and there will be only one registry key named "Data"*
```sh
Example 2:
C:\sample1\Data_rtd
C:\sample1\wsrtd
```
*Data2 and wsrtd will be a new entries and each can have its own settings*

## Client-Data Sender application
For production release:
```sh
To do:
For now, this integration depends on the user and technical skill
Client-sender program should be developed using Vendor specific library.
Working on providing a Relay Server
```

> Note: `--rolesend` is required for client-sender identification

Example rolesend: data vendor / broker client program / Python sample server

> Note: `--rolerecv` is required for client-receiver identification

Example rolerecv: Ws_Rtd plugin or ArcticDB data collection socket conn

Verify the connection by navigating to your terminal running the server

```sh
127.0.0.1:10101
```
#### 1) Specifics of Client-Sender Application
The design itself keeps in mind a minimal requirement so the application just needs to conform with the fol1owing:
- Client-Sender connects to the matching websocket port
- On connection, it sends the above simple string "rolesend" before any other data
- Then it follows the json-RTD format for realtime bars matching the interval set in AB configure DB
- To handle Requests from Data Plug-in, it will receive the json-CMD or json-Hist. It should respond with the appropriate json formats described above. That's it.
- The Advantage of using a relay server is that when either Plug-ins or Client applications reconnect or disconnect, they don't cause the other party websocket drop errors which is distracting as well.

< more documentation on this later >
The Programming Language of choice or platform does not in any way become restrictive to the user.

# FAQs
#### 1) Can I Backfill data when the Status is Shutdown?
As the websocket is disconnected, no commands can be sent or received, therefore it is not possible.
However, Data available inside the plugin-DB can still be accessed for symbols to get updated.

#### 2) I Imported data using Amibroker ASCII Importer, now I have duplicate or Corrupt data.
By design, it is up to the user to ensure that duplicate data is not imported. Mixing two different methods can cause unwanted behaviour.
You can delete all the data and import it afresh.
Some steps are taken when using plug-in to overwrite duplicate data.
However, this Plug-in is quite technical and for performance, the user's Client side application should ensure data integrity.

#### 3) Some of my Symbols are not updating with data but my Server shows that data for RTD is generated.
Ensure that under Symbol Information window in Amibroker, the setting "Use local database only" is set to No. If yes, Plug-in cannot update to it.

#### 4) How do I ADD symbols in AmiBroker?
When new symbols arrrive in the plugin-DB, the plugin status will be dark Green in colour. You can go to Configure settings Dialog and Click RETRIEVE Button. Symbols will automatically get added.

## Development
Want to contribute? Great!
##### A)
For now Clent-sender applications have a lot of scope for expansion
Current Relay Server is python-based.
Client-sender can be in a Programming Language of your choice or using Data Vendor library,
these applications can be expanded greatly to encompass various Brokers APIs and Data Vendors.
##### B)
WS_RTD uses C++ for development, strongly based on ATL/MFC, but is currently closed.
